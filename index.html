<p>I am Bo-Yun Hsu, and I am excited to take this course! I love STEM, and I want to pursue
    a career in it. I am a 9th grader at Gretchen Whitney High School, and I am looking forward 
    to learning about website development, and learning new languages. I am also in a robotics competition, one called FIRST Tech Challenge. 
    I want to learn more about computer science to be better at it. I like to learn new things, and I am often curious.
